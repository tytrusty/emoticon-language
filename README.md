# emoticon-language

A really unintuitive language where everything is done with emoticons...
Not much is implemented right now, but basic integer assignment is function and comments are functioning.

Example:

(#_#) this is a comment  o_o
(#_#)--*

  this is a multi-line comment

*--(#_#) 
o \\(^-^)/ 5   (#_#) This represents assignment: o = 5  untyped integer creation 

Will produce in a c file:
int o = 5;
